2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net audioC/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin audioC/mic_out_reg[4]_i_2__0/O, cell audioC/mic_out_reg[4]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net button_D/DFF_1/bD is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin button_D/DFF_1/btnD_flip_i_2/O, cell button_D/DFF_1/btnD_flip_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net button_L/DFF_1/bL is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin button_L/DFF_1/btnL_flip_i_2/O, cell button_L/DFF_1/btnL_flip_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net button_R/DFF_1/bR is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin button_R/DFF_1/btnR_flip_i_2/O, cell button_R/DFF_1/btnR_flip_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net button_U/DFF_1/bU is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin button_U/DFF_1/btnU_flip_i_2/O, cell button_U/DFF_1/btnU_flip_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ms_paint/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ms_paint/data_color_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell ms_paint/data_color_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ms_paint/oled_data_reg[5]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ms_paint/current_color_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell ms_paint/current_color_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net peak_amp/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin peak_amp/mic_out_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell peak_amp/mic_out_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
